💻 Technologies & AWS Services Used

Compute: AWS Lambda, EC2 (optional for hosting)

API Gateway: To create RESTful APIs securely

Database: DynamoDB (NoSQL) / RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) based on use case

Authentication: Amazon Cognito for user sign-up and login

Storage: Amazon S3 for static assets and file uploads

IAM: Role-based access management and policies

Monitoring: CloudWatch for logging and metrics

Deployment: AWS CLI, SAM (Serverless Application Model)

Other Tools: Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Postman for API testing
